## Bullets  
  

- User creates an account
- User Hatches an egg to get a pet
- User raises the pet over digital time 
   

## Inspiration   
  
- Tamagochi
- Chao from Sonic Adventure 
  
  
## Considerations    
  

- Easier to code in python, but harder to integrate into a webapp. 
- FARM stack, using python, fastapi, react and MongoDB
- MERN stack, using Mongo, Express web, react and node.  
  
React probably isn't required, just a DB that can be deployed, backend logic to manage lifecycle, javascript to manage button actions and slide images, css bootstrapping to make the app mobile compatible. 

Decision: I should probably do it all in javascript, but mocking out in FARM might be easier.
